;; This guide will try to give you a basic
;; understanding of the Clojure language. Basic in
;; the sense that it is not extensive. Basic in the
;; sense that it is foundational. Building from first
;; principles in order to make the Clujure journey
;; you have ahead easier to comprehend.
;; With the foundations in place you'll have a good 
;; chance of having the right gut feeling for how to
;; code something, to formmulating your questions,
;; googling for information, make sense of code you
;; stumble across, and so on.

;; There will be links here and there, ctrl/cmd-click
;; those to open them in a browser. Here's the first
;; such link; 
;; https://clojure.org/guides/learn/syntax
;; There you can read more about the concepts
;; mentioned in this guide.

;; The way to use the guide is to read about the
;; concepts and evaluate the examples. Please feel
;; encouraged to edit the examples, and add new code
;; and evaluate that. Evaluate this to warm up:

(str "Evaluate"
     " and "
     "experiment")

(comment
  ;; = EXPRESSIONS =
  ;; In Clojure everything is an expression.
  ;; (There are no statements.) Unless there is
  ;; en error when evaluating the expressions there
  ;; is always a return value (which is sometimes `nil`).

  ;; An important aspect of this is that the result
  ;; of an expession is always the last form/expression
  ;; evaluated. E.g. if you have a function defined
  ;; like so:
  (defn last-eval-wins []
    (println 'side-effect-1)
    1
    (println 'side-effect-2)
    2)
  ;; (Just, evaluate it. This defines a function named
  ;; `last-eval-wins`, taking no argumentsm, with four
  ;; expressions in its function body. We'll return to
  ;; defining functions.)
  ;; Calling the function (Just ealuate it.)
  (last-eval-wins)
  ;; will cause all four expressions in the function
  ;; body to be evaluated. The result of the call will
  ;; be the last expression that was evaluated.

  ;; In the output window you will also see the
  ;; `println` calls happening. They are also
  ;; expressions, evaluating `nil`.
  (println 'prints-this-evalautes-to-nil)

  ;; Expressions are composed from literals (evaluating
  ;; to themselves) and/or calls to either
  ;; * special forms
  ;; * macros
  ;; * functions 
  ;; Calls are written as lists with the called thing
  ;; as the first element.
  (str 1 2 3)
  ;; Calls the function `str` with the arguments
  ;; 1, 2, and 3. ‚ÄùHello World‚Äù above is a literal
  ;; string (thus it evaluates to itself).
  ;; More about literals coming up next!

  ;; = COLLECTIONS =
  ;; Clojure has literal syntax for four collection types
  ;; They evaluate to themselves.
  '(1 2 3)     ; list (a quoted list, more about this below)
  [1 2 3]      ; vector
  #{1 2 3}     ; set
  {:a 1 :b 2}  ; map

  ;; They compose
  {:foo [1 2]
   :bar #{1 2}}

  ;; = FUNCTIONS =
  ;; So far you have been able to evaluate all examples.
  ;; It's because we quoted that list.
  ;; Actually lists look like so
  (1 2 3)
  ;; If you evaluate that, you'll get an error:
  ;; => class java.lang.Long cannot be cast to class clojure.lang.IFn
  ;; (Of course, the linter already warned you.)
  ;; This is because the Clojure will try to call
  ;; `1` as a function. When evaluating unquoted lists
  ;; the first element in the list is regarded as being
  ;; in ‚Äùfunction position‚Äù. A Clojure program is data. 
  ;; In fancier words, Clojure is homoiconic:
  ;; https://wiki.c2.com/?HomoiconicLanguages
  ;; This gives great macro power, more about that below

  ;; Here are some lists with proper functions at
  ;; position 1:
  (str 1 2 3 4 5 :foo)
  (< 1 2 3 4 5)
  (*)
  (= "1"
     (str "1")
     (str \1))
  (println "From Clojure with ‚ô•Ô∏è")
  (reverse [5 4 3 2 1])
  ;; Everything after the first position is
  ;; handed to the function as arguments

  ;; Note: We refer to literals, symbols and literal
  ;; collections, collectivelly as forms, sometimes,
  ;; sexprs: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-expression

  ;; You define new functions and bind them to names
  ;; in the current namespace using the macro `defn`.
  ;; It's a very flexible macro. Here's a simple use:
  (defn add2
    [arg]
    (+ arg 2))
  ;; It defines the function `add2` taking one argument.
  ;; The function body calls the core functions `+`
  ;; with the arguments `arg` and 2.
  ;; Evaluating the form will define it and you'll see:
  ;; => #'hello-clojure/add2
  ;; That's a var ‚Äùholding‚Äù the value of the function
  ;; You can now reference the var using the symbol
  ;; `add2`. Putting it in the function position of a
  ;; list with 3 in the first argument position and 
  ;; evaluating the list gives us back what?
  (add2 3)

  ;; Clojure has an extensive core library of functions
  ;; and macros. See: https://clojuredocs.org for a community
  ;; driven Clojure core (and more) search engine.
  )

(comment
  ;; = SPECIAL FORMS =
  ;; The core libarary is composed from the functions and macros
  ;; in the library itself. Bootstrapping the library is
  ;; a few (15-ish) built-in primitive forms,
  ;; aka ‚Äùspecial forms‚Äù.

  ;; You have met one of these special forms already:
  (quote (1 2 3))
  ;; The doc hover of the symbol `quote` tells you that
  ;; it is a special form.

  ;; Wondering where you met this special form before?
  ;; We used the shorthand syntax for it then:
  '(1 2 3)

  ;; Convince yourself they are the same with the `=` function:
  (= (quote (1 2 3))
     '(1 2 3))
  ;; Clojure has value semantics. Any data structures
  ;; that evaluate to the same data are equal,
  ;; no matter how deep or big the structures are.
  (= [1 [1 #{1 {:a 1 :b '(:foo bar)}}]]
     [1 [1 #{1 {:a (- 3 2) :b (quote (:foo bar))}}]])

  ;; ... but that was a detour, back to special forms.
  ;; Offical docs:
  ;; https://clojure.org/reference/special_forms#_other_special_forms

  ;; A very important special form is `fn` (which is
  ;; actually four special forms, but anyway).
  ;; Without this form we can't define new functions.
  ;; The following form evaluates to a function which 
  ;; adds 2 to its argument.
  (fn [arg] (+ arg 2))

  ;; Calling the function with the argument 3:
  ((fn [arg] (+ arg 2)) 3)

  ;; Another special form is `def`. It defines things,
  ;; giving them namespaced names.
  (def foo :foo)
  ;; ‚ÄùDefining a thing‚Äù means that a var is created,
  ;; holding the value, and that a symbol is bound
  ;; to the var. Evaluating the symbol, picks up the
  ;; value from the var it is bound to
  foo
  ;; The var can be accessed using the `var` special
  ;; form.
  (var foo)
  ;; You will most often see the var-quote shorthand
  #'foo

  ;; With these two special foms we can define functions
  (def add2-2 (fn [arg] (+ arg 2)))
  (add2-2 3)

  ;; This is what the macro `defn` does.
  ;; We can use the function `macroexpand` to see this:
  (macroexpand '(defn add2
                  [arg]
                  (+ arg 2)))

  ;; Yet another super duper important special form:
  (if 'test
    'value-if-true
    'value-if-false)
  ;; Rumour has it that all conditional constructs (macros)
  ;; are built using `if`. Try to imagine a programming language
  ;; without conditionals!

  ;; We'll return to `if` and conditionals. Let's wrap
  ;; the special forms section up with just noting that
  ;; together with _how_ Clojure reads and evaluates code,
  ;; the special forms make up the Clojure langugage
  ;; itself. The next level of building blocks are
  ;; macros. But let's investigate this with how code
  ;; is read first...
  )

(comment
  ;; = THE READER =
  ;; https://clojure.org/reference/reader
  ;; The Clojure Reader is responsible for reading text,
  ;; making data from it, which is what the compiler gets.
  ;; The Reader is where literals, symbols, strings, lists,
  ;; vectors, maps, and sets are picked apart and
  ;; re-assembled, figuring out what is a function,
  ;; a macro or special form.

  ;; In doing this whitespace plays a key role, there
  ;; are also some extra syntax rules in play.

  ;; == WHITESPACE ==
  ;; Most things you would think counts as whitespace
  ;; is whitespace, and then there is also that Clojure,
  ;; being a LISP, does not need commas to separate
  ;; list items, since whitespace is enough. However,
  ;; Commas can be used for this, since:
  ;; commas are whitespace!
  (= '(1 2 3)
     '(1,2,3)
     '(1, 2, 3)
     '(1,,,,2,,,,3))
  ;; (There are no operators in Clojure, `=` is a
  ;; function. It will check for equality of all
  ;; arguments it is passed.)

  ;; == LINE COMMENTS ==
  ;; The Reader skips reading everything on a line from
  ;; a semicolon. This is unstructured comments in
  ;; that if you start a form
  (range 1 ; 10)
  ;; and then place a line commment so that the closing
  ;; bracket of that form gets commented out, the
  ;; structure breaks.
         )
  ;;     ^ Healing the structure.        
  ;; If you remove the semicolon on the opening form
  ;; above, make sure to also remove this closing paren.           

  ;; Since everything on the line is ignored, you can
  ;; add as many semicolons as you want.
  ;;;;;;;;;; (skipped by the Reader)
  ;; It's common to use two semicolons to start a full
  ;; line comment. 

  ;; == EXRA SYNTAX ===
  ;; We've already seen the single quote
  'something
  ;; Which is, as we have seen, transfromed to
  (quote something)
  ;; There are some more quoting, and even splicing
  ;; symbols, which we won't cover in this guide.

  ;; === Deref ===
  ;; Clojure also has reference types, we'll discuss
  ;; (briefly) the most common one, `atom`, later.
  (def an-atom (atom [1 2 3]))
  (type an-atom)
  ;; To access value from a reference:
  (deref an-atom)
  (type (deref an-atom))
  ;; This is so common that there is shorthand syntax
  @an-atom
  (= (deref an-atom)
     @an-atom)
  ;; It's a common mistake to forget to deref
  (first an-atom)
  (first @an-atom)

  ;; === THE DISPATCHER (HASH SIGN) ===
  ;; Regular expressions have literal syntax, they are
  ;; written like strings, but with a hash sign in front
  #"reg(?:ular )?exp(?:ression)?"
  ;; Regexps are handled by the host platform, so they
  ;; are Java regexes in this tutorial.
  (re-seq *1 "regexp regular expression")
  ;; *1 is a special symbol for a variable holding the
  ;; value of the last evaluation result.

  ;; That hash sign shows up now and then, for instance
  #(+ % 2)
  ;; Which is special syntax for ‚Äùfunction literals‚Äù, a
  ;; way to specify a function.
  ;; The example above is equivalent to this anonymous
  ;; function.
  (fn [arg] (+ arg 2))
  ;; Nesting function literals is forbidden activity
  ;(#(+ % (#(- % 2) 3)))
  ;; (thankfully)

  ;; The hash sign has a special role. It is aka
  ;; Dispatch. Depending on what character is following
  ;; it, different cool things happen.
  ;; In addition to sets, regexps and function literals
  ;; we have seen var-quotes in this guide
  #'add2

  ;; There is a very useful hash-dispatcher which
  ;; is used to make the Reader ignore the next form
  #_(println "The reader will not send this function call
to the compiler") "This is not ignored"
  ;; To test this select the ignore marker together with
  ;; the function call and the string, then use Ctrl+Enter,
  ;; to make Calva send it all to the Reader, which will
  ;; read it, ignore the function call, and only evaluate
  ;; the string.
  ;; Since #_ ignores the next form it is a structural
  ;; comment mechanism, often used to temporarily disable
  ;; some code or some data
  (str "a" "b" #_(str 1 2 3 [4 5 6]) "c")
  ;; Ignore markers stack
  (str "a" #_#_"b" (str 1 2 3 [4 5 6]) "c")
  ;; Note that the Reader _will_ read the ignored form.
  ;; If there are syntactic errors in there, the
  ;; Reader will get sad, complain, and stop Reading.
  ;; Select from the marker up to and including the string
  ;; here and press Ctrl+Enter
  ;#_(#(+ % (#(- % 2) 3))) "foo"
  
  ;; Two more common #-variants you will see, and use,
  ;; are namespaced map keyword shorthand syntax and
  ;; tagged literals, aka, data readers. Let's start
  ;; with the former:
  (= #:foo {:bar 'bar
            :baz 'baz}
     {:foo/bar 'bar
      :foo/baz 'baz})
  ;; Unrelated to the #: There is another shorthand for
  ;; speecifying namespaced keywords. Double colon
  ;; keywords get namespaced with the current namespace
  ::foo
  (= ::foo :hello-clojure/foo)

  ;; Tagged literals, then. It's a way to invoke functions
  ;; bound to the tags on the form following it.
  ;; https://clojure.org/reference/reader#tagged_literals
  ;; They are also referred to as data readers. You can
  ;; define your own. Here let it suffice with mentioning
  ;; the two build in ones.

  ;; #inst will convert the string it tags to an instance
  #inst "2018-03-28T10:48:00.000"
  (type *1)

  ;; #uuid will make an UUID of the string it tags
  #uuid "0000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000016"
  (java.util.UUID/fromString "0000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000016")

  ;; You now know how to read (in the sense of you
  ;; being a Clojure Reader) most Clojure code.
  ;; That said, let's skip going into the syntax
  ;; sugar and special forms for making host platform
  ;; interop extra nice.
  ;; https://clojure.org/reference/java_interop
  ;; Just a sneak peek:
  (.before #inst "2018-03-28T10:48:00.000"
           #inst "2021-02-17T00:27:00.000")
  ;; This invokes the method `before` on the date
  ;; object for year 2018 giving it the date from
  ;; year 2021 as argument.

(comment
  ;; = MACROS =
  ;; Clojure has powerful data transformation
  ;; capabilities. We'll touch on that a bit later.
  ;; Here we want to highlight that this power can
  ;; be weilded for extending the language. 
  ;; Since Clojure code is structured and code is
  ;; data, Clojure can be used to produce Clojure
  ;; code from Clojure code. It is similar to the
  ;; preprocessor fascilites that some languages
  ;; offer, like C's `#pragma`, but it is much more
  ;; convenient and pwerful. A lot of you will learn
  ;; to love and recognize as Clojure is actually
  ;; created with Clojure, as macros.

  ;; This guide is mostly concerned with letting you
  ;; know that macros are a thing, to help you to
  ;; quicklyrealize when you are using a macro rather 
  ;; thana function. So we will not go into the
  ;; subject of hpw to creating macros.

  ;; == `when` ==
  ;; Let's just briefly examine the macro`when`.
  ;; This macrohelps with writing more readable code.
  ;; How?Let's say you want to conditionally evaluate
  ;; something. Above you learnt about that there is
  ;; a special form named `if` that can be used for
  ;; this. Like so:
  (if 'this-is-true
    'evaluate-this
    'else-evaluate-this)
  ;; Now say you don't have something to evaluate
  ;; in the else case. `if` allows you to write this
  (if 'this-is-true
    'evaluate-this)
  ;; Which is fine, but you will have to scan the
  ;; code a bit extra to see that there is no else
  ;; branch. To address this, you could write:
  (if 'this-is-true
    'evaluate-this
    nil)
  ;; But that is a bit silly, what if there was a
  ;; way to tell the human reading the code that
  ;; there is no else? There is!
  (when 'this-is-true
    'evaluate-this)
  ;; Let's look at how `when` is defined, you can
  ;; ctrl/cmd-click `when` to navigate to where
  ;; it is defined in Clojure core.
  ;; You can also use the function `macroexpand`
  (macroexpand '(when 'this-is-true
                  'evaluate-this))
  ;; You'll notice that `when` wraps the body in
  ;; a `(do ...)`, which is a special form that lets
  ;; you evaluate several expressions, returning the
  ;; results of the last one.
  ;; https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/do
  ;; `do` is handy when you want to have some side-
  ;; effect going in addition to evaluating something.
  ;; In development this often happens when you 
  ;; want to `println` something before result of the
  ;; expression is evaluated.
  (do (println "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog")
      (+ 2 2))
  ;; The `when` macro let's you take advantage of that
  ;; there is only one branch, so you can do this
  (when 'this-is-true
    (println "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog")
    (+ 2 2))
  ;; Without `when` you would write:
  (if 'this-is-true
    (do
      (println "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog")
      (+ 2 2)))
  ;; Here `when` saves us both the extra scanning for
  ;; the else-branch and the use of `do`.

  ;; As far as macros go, `when` is about as simple as
  ;; they get. From two built-in special forms,
  ;; `if` and `do`, it composes a form that helps us
  ;; write easy to write and easy to read code. 

  ;; == `let` ==
  ;; A less simple core library macro is `let`. It
  ;; is a form that lets you bind values to variables
  ;; that will be used in the body of the form.
  (let [x 1
        y 2]
    (str x y))

  ;; The bindings are provided as the first ‚Äùargument‚Äù,
  ;; in a vector. This is a pattern that is used by
  ;; other macrors that let you define bindings.
  ;; It is similar to the lexical scope of other
  ;; programming lannguages ()even if this rather is
  ;; structural). Sibling and parent forms do not
  ;; ‚Äùsee‚Äù these bindings.
  (do
    (def x :namespace-x)
    (println "`x` in `do` _before_ `let`: " x)
    (let [x :let-x]
      (println "`x` from `let`: " x))
    (println "`x` in `do`, _after_ `let`: " x))
  ;; The `def` special form defines things ‚Äùglobally‚Äù
  (println "`x` _outside_ `do`: " x)

  ;; == `for` ==
  ;; The `for` macro really demonstrates how Clojure
  ;; can be extended using Clojure. `for` gives us
  ;; list comprehensions (if you have Pyhton experience,
  ;; yes, that kind of list comprehensions).
  ;; Here's how to produce the cartesian product of two
  ;; vectors, `x` and `y`:
  (for [x [1 2 3]
        y [1 2 3 4]]
    [x y])
  ;; `for` also lets you filter the results
  (for [x [1 2 3]
        y [1 2 3 4]
        :when (not= x y)]
    [x y])
  ;; You can bind variable names in the comprehension
  (for [x [1 2 3]
        y [1 2 3 4]
        :let [d' (- x y)
              d (Math/abs d')]]
    d)
  ;; Filters and bindings can be used together can you
  ;; Use both `:let` and `:when` to meak this
  ;; comprehension return a list of all `[x y]` where
  ;; their sum is odd. The functions `+` and `odd?`
  ;; are your friends here.
  (for [x [1 2 3]
        y [1 2 3 4]]
    [x y])
  ;; See https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lvV9ICwaMo for
  ;; a great primer on Clojure list comprehensions
  ;; See https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/for for
  ;; example usages and tips.

  ;; Note that even though `let` and `for` look like
  ;; functions, they are not. The compiler would not
  ;; like it if you are passing undefined symbols to a
  ;; function. This is valid code:
  (let [abc 1] 2)
  ;; This isn't.
  (str [abc 1] 2)
  ;; We are mentioning this here so that you will know
  ;; why when you ask other Clojurians something like:
  ;;   ‚ÄùWhy is X not working, when Y is?‚Äù 
  ;; you sometimes get the answer
  ;;   ‚ÄùIt's because Y is a macro‚Äù
  ;; Macros extend the Clojure compiler.
  ;; We suggest bookmarking this page:
  ;;   https://clojure.org/reference/macros

  ;; == Threading macros ==
  ;; Macros can totally rearrange your code. The
  ;; built-in ‚Äùthreading‚Äù macros do this. Sometimes
  ;; when the nesting of function(-ish) calls get
  ;; deep it can get a bit hard to read and to keep
  ;; track of all the parens

  ;; You read Clojure from the innermost expression
  ;; and out, which gets easier with time, but an

  ;; Let's read this together. The thread-last macro,

  (->> [1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21]
       (partition 2))
  ;; The first argument/element passed to `->>` is

  ;; This partitions the list into lists of
  ;; 2 elements => `((1 1) (2 3) (5 8) (13 21))`
  ;; This new list is then inserted (threaded)
  ;; as the last argument to the next function,
  ;; yielding:
  (zipmap [:a :b :c :d] '((1 1) (2 3) (5 8) (13 21)))
  ;; Which ‚Äùzips‚Äù together a Clojure map using
  ;; the first list as keys and the second list
  ;; as values
  ;; => `{:a (1 1), :b (2 3), :c (5 8), :d (13 21)}`
  ;; This map is then threaded as the last argument
  ;; to the function `:d`
  (:d '{:a (1 1), :b (2 3), :c (5 8), :d (13 21)})
  ;; (In clojure keywords are functions that look
  ;;  themselves up in the map handed to them.)
  ;; => `(13 21)`
  ;; You know the drill by now, this is threaded
  (apply - '(13 21))
  ;; Which applies the `-` function over the list
  ;; => `-8`
  ;; Then this is treaded to `Math/abs`

;; With special forms, the special syntax of the Reader,
;; and macros, the foundations of what is the Clojure
;; language you use are laid. You can of course extend
;; the language further with libraries including macros
;; or create your own. However the core language, with
;; its macros is very expressive. Taking data oriented
;; approaches is often enough. Even to prefer, rather
;; than creating more macros.

;; On to flow control!

(comment
  ;; = Flow Control, Conditionals, Branching =
  ;; Clojure is richer than most languages in what it
  ;; offers us to let our programs flow the way we want
  ;; them to. Almost all the core library features for
  ;; this are implemented using the primitive (special
  ;; form) `if`. This is still the staple for us as
  ;; Clojure coders. It takes three forms as its
  ;; arguments:
  ;; 1. A condition to evaluate
  ;; 2. What to evaluate if the condition evaluates
  ;;    to something true (truthy)
  ;; 3. The form to evaluate if the condition does not
  ;;    evaluate to something truthy (the ‚Äùelse‚Äù branch)
  ;; Roll this dice, some ten-twenty times, checking if
  ;; it is a six:
  (if (= 6 (inc (rand-int 6)))
    "One time out of six you get a six"
    "Five times out of six you get something else")
  ;; Since there are no statements in Clojure `if` is
  ;; the equivalent to the ternary `if` expression you
  ;; find in C and many other languages:
  ;;   test ? true-expressiong : false-expression
  ;; Pseudo code for our dice:
  ;;   int(rand() * 6) + 1 == 6 ?
  ;;     "One time out of six you get a six" :
  ;;     "Five times out of six you get something else";

  ;; == The Search for Truth ==
  ;; Again, in Clojure we use expressions evaluating to
  ;; values. When examined for branching all values
  ;; are either truthy or falsy. In fact, almost all
  ;; values are truthy
  (if true :truthy :falsy)
  (if :foo :truthy :falsy)
  (if '() :truthy :falsy)
  (if 0 :truthy :falsy)
  (if "" :truthy :falsy)
  ;; The only falsy values are `false` and `nil`
  (if false :truthy :falsy)
  (if nil :truthy :falsy)
  (when false :truthy)
  ;; About that last one: `when` evaluates to `nil`
  ;; when the condition is falsy. Since `nil` is 
  ;; falsy the above `when` expression would be
  ;; making the ‚Äùelse‚Äù branch of an `if` to be
  ;; evaluated
  (if (when false :truthy) :true :falsy)
  ;; (Super extra bad code, but anyway)
  ;; When only boolean truth or falsehood can cut
  ;; it for you, there is the `true?` function
  (true? true)
  (true? 0)
  (true? '())
  (true? nil)
  (true? false)
  ;; Thus
  (if (true? 0) :true :false)

  ;; == `when` ==
  ;; As mentioned before, `when` is a one-branch
  ;; `if`, only for the truthy branch, wich is
  ;; wrapped in a `do` for you. Try this and then
  ;; try it replacing the `when` with an `if`:
  (when :truthy
    (println "That sounds true to me")
    :truthy-for-you)
  ;; If the `when` condition is not truthy,
  ;; `nil` will be returned.
  (when nil :true-enough?)

  ;; == `cond` ==
  ;; Since deeply nested if/else structures can be
  ;; hard to write, read, and maintain, Clojure core
  ;; offers several more constructs for flow control,
  ;; one very commone such is the `cond` macro. It
  ;; takes pairs of condition/result forms, tests
  ;; each condition, if it is true, then the result
  ;; form is evaluated and ‚Äùreturned‚Äù, short-cicuiting
  ;; so that no more condition is tested.
  (let [dice-roll (inc (rand-int 6))]
    (cond
      (= 6 dice-roll)  "Six is as high as it gets"
      (odd? dice-roll) (str "An odd roll " dice-roll " is")
      :else            (str "Not six, nor odd, instead: " dice-roll)))
  ;; The `:else` is just the keyword `:else` which
  ;; evaluates to itself and is truthy. It is the
  ;; conventional way to give your cond forms a
  ;; default value. Without a default clause, the
  ;; form would evaluate to `nil` for anything not-six
  ;; not-odd. Try it by placing two ignore markers
  ;; (`#_ #_`) in front of the `:else` keyword.

  ;; Gotta love Clojuredocs
  ;; https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/cond
  ;; Paste examples from there here and play around:

  ;; See also links to `cond->` info above

  ;; == `case` ==
  ;; A bit similar to `switch/case` constructs in
  ;; other languages, Clojure core has the `case`
  ;; macro whcih takes a test expression, followed by
  ;; zero or more clauses (pairs) of test constant/expr,
  ;; followed by an optional expr. (However, the body
  ;; after the test expression may not be empty.)
  (let [test-str "foo bar"]
    (case test-str
      "foo bar" (str "That's very " :foo-bar)
      "baz"     :baz
      (count    test-str)))
  ;; The trailing expression, if any, is ‚Äùreturned‚Äù as
  ;; the default value.
  (let [test-str "foo bar"]
    (case test-str
      #_#_"foo bar" (str "That's very " :foo-bar)
      "baz"     :baz
      (count    test-str)))
  ;; If no clause matches and there is no default,
  ;; a run time error happens
  (let [test-str "foo bar"]
    (case test-str
      #_#_"foo bar" (str "That's very " :foo-bar)
      "baz"     :baz
      #_(count    test-str)))

  ;; WATCH OUT! A test constant must be a compile
  ;; time literal, and the compiler won't  help you
  ;; find bugs like this:
  (let [test-int 2
        two 2]
    (case test-int
      1     :one
      two   (str "That's not a literal 2")
      (str test-int ": Probably not expected")))

  ;; The Functional Design in Clojure podcast has a
  ;; fantastic episode about branching
  ;; https://clojuredesign.club/episode/089-branching-out/

  ;; == Less branching is good, right? ==
  ;; The core library is rich with functions that
  ;; helps you avoid writing branching code. Instead
  ;; you provide the condition as a predicate.
  ;; An often used predicate function is `filter`
  (filter even? [0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12])
  ;; and its ‚Äùsibling‚Äù `remove`
  (remove odd? [0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12])
  ;; Filtering sequences of values is a common task
  ;; and your programming time can instead be used
  ;; to decide _how_ it should be filtered, by writing
  ;; the predicate. Sometimes you don't even need to
  ;; do that, Clojure core is rich with predicates
  (even? 0)
  (neg? 0)
  (pos? 0)
  (nat-int? 0)
  (empty? "")
  (empty? [])
  (empty? (take 0 [1 2 3]))
  (integer? 2/1)
  (indexed? [1 2 3])
  (indexed? '(1 2 3))
  ;; What's a predicate? For the purpose of this guide
  ;; A predicate is a function testing things for
  ;; truthiness. Some take only one argument, and it is
  ;; convention that these functions end with `?`.
  
  ;; A handy predicate is `some?` which tests for
  ;; "somethingness‚Äù, if it is not `nil` it is
  ;; something
  (some? nil)
  (some? false)
  (some? '())
  ;; You can use it to test for if something is `nil`
  ;; by wrapping it in a call to the `not` function
  (not (some? nil))
  (not (some? false))
  ;; You get the urge to define a function named `nil?`,
  ;; right? You don't have to
  (nil? nil)

  ;; There are also predicates that take a predicate
  ;; plus a collection to apply it on.
  ;; Such as `every?`
  (every? nat-int? [0 1 2])
  (every? nat-int? [-1 0 1 2])

  ;; (This pattern with functions that take functions
  ;; as argument is common in Clojure.)
